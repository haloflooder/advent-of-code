# Advent of Code

Just heard about this today and decided to try to do this annually.

## 2021

For [2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/), going to attempt to use a different language everyday.

**Rules**
- You can use a language that was already used
- You cannot use the same language within a week from each other from when it was previously used
